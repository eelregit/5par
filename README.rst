Five parameters are all you need
================================

In ΛCDM, we demote the optical depth τ\ :sub:`reio` to a derived
parameter with analytic modeling and symbolic regression of 21cmFAST
reionization timelines.

The key points are:

* We discover that reionization history has a universal shape,
  independent of cosmology or astrophysics, in both modeling and
  parameters;
* The Gompertz function, introduced 200 years ago to model human
  mortality, also well describes the mortality of neutral hydrogen in
  the Universe;
* Our reionization history is asymmetric in time, as preferred by
  simulation and observational data, unlike the conventional tanh model;
* We demote the reionization optical depth, the 6th cosmological
  parameter and an empirical one, to a derived parameter, as function of
  the other 5 cosmological parameters and astrophysics;
* We tighten the constraint on the optical depth τ\ :sub:`reio` by 5
  times, and that on the primordial scalar amplitude A\ :sub:`s` by more
  than 2 times;
* For the first time, we “detect” the ionizing efficiency ζ\ :sub:`UV`
  at high significance, the dominating parameter for reionization, a
  leap from the previous result consistent with zero.
