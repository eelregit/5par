The standard cosmological model, with its six independent parameters,
successfully describes our observable Universe.
One of these parameters, the optical depth to reionization $\tau_\reio$,
represents the scatterings that Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
photons will experience after decoupling from the primordial plasma as
the intergalactic medium transitions from neutral to ionized.
$\tau_\reio$ depends on the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\HI$, which, in
turn, should theoretically depend on cosmology.
We present a novel method to establish the missing link between
cosmology and reionization timeline using symbolic regression.
We discover the timeline has a universal shape well described by the
Gompertz mortality law, applicable to any cosmology within our simulated
data.
Unlike the conventional tanh prescription, our model is asymmetric in
time and a good fit to astrophysical constraints on $x_\HI$.
By combining CMB with astrophysical data and marginalizing over
astrophysics, we treat $\tau_\reio$ as a derived parameter, tightening
its constraint to $<3\%$.
This approach reduces the error on the amplitude of the primordial
fluctuations by a factor of 2.3 compared to Planck's PR3 constraint and
provides a commanding constraint on the ionization efficiency $\zetaUV =
26.9^{+2.1}_{-2.5}$.
We expect further improvements in the near term as reionization
constraints increase and our understanding of reionization advances.
